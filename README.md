This Python code helps you explore finding the minimum and maximum values in an array. You can run the code and interact with it to understand the process.

Features:
Prompts the user to enter the size of the array.
Asks the user to input each element individually.
Finds the minimum and maximum values in the array.
Prints the results to the console.

Getting Started:
Save the following code as a Python file (.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the file.
Run the Python file using the command python <filename>.py.

Learning Points:
This code demonstrates how to take user input and store it in an array.
It uses loops to iterate through the array and compare each element to the current minimum and maximum values.
The built-in functions min and max can also be used for finding the minimum and maximum values in an array.
